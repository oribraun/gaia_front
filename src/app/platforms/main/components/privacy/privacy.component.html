            <h3>19. Arbitration</h3>
            <p>
                19.1 Agreement to Arbitrate. This Section 19 is referred to herein as the "Arbitration
                Agreement." The parties that any and all controversies, claims, or disputes between you
                and Gaia arising out of, relating to, or resulting from this Agreement, shall be subject
                to binding arbitration pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Arbitration Agreement,
                and not any court action (other than a small claims court action to the extent the claim
                qualifies). The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
                Arbitration Agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
                19.2 Class Action Waiver. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
                OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
                CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE
                ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT
                OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
                ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY
                RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT
                NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).
            </p>
            <p>
                19.3 Procedures. Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with
                the American Arbitration Association’s ("AAA") rules and procedures (the "AAA Rules"),
                as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. If there is any inconsistency between the AAA
                Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control
                unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration
                Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must
                also follow the provisions of this Agreement as a court would, including without limitation,
                the limitation of liability provisions in Section 8. You may visit http://www.adr.org for
                information on the AAA and http://www.adr.org/fileacase for information on how to file a
                claim against the Gaia.
            </p>
            <p>
                19.4 Venue. The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another
                mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or
                Gaia may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written
                submissions, which election shall be binding on each party, but subject to the arbitrator's
                discretion to require an in-person hearing if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at any
                in-person hearing may be made by telephone by either or both parties unless the arbitrator
                requires otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
                19.5 Governing Law. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance
                with the laws of the state of Delaware, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules, and
                will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by
                rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Service users, but is bound by rulings in
                prior arbitrations involving you to the extent required by applicable law.
            </p>
            <p>
                19.6 Costs of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees
                (collectively, the "Arbitration Fees") will be governed by the AAA's Rules.  Each party
                will be responsible for all other fees it incurs in connection with the arbitration,
                including without limitation, all attorney fees.
            </p>
            <p>
                19.7 Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision
                or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                19.8 Severability. If a court decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration
                Agreement other than Section 19.2 is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace
                such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
                comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
                and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court decides that
                any of the provisions of Section 19.2 is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this
                Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The remainder of this Agreement will continue
                to apply.
            </p>
            <h3>20. Waiver and Severability of Terms</h3>
            <p>The failure of Gaia to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms and Conditions of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms and Conditions of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms and Conditions of Use remain in full force and effect.</p>
